# Socket-based-Chat-Application-in-C-Language
This project is a simple chat application that allows multiple clients to connect and communicate with each other using sockets in C language. The chat application uses TCP/IP socket programming to establish a reliable and efficient communication network.

The server-side of the application uses socket programming to accept incoming connections from multiple clients, allowing them to communicate with each other in real-time. The client-side of the application also uses socket programming to establish a connection with the server and communicate with other clients.

The chat application features a user-friendly command-line interface that allows clients to join, leave, and send messages to a chat room. The chat room can support multiple clients at the same time, and messages are broadcasted to all connected clients.

The project is implemented using modular programming, making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones. It also includes error handling mechanisms to ensure the application runs smoothly without any unexpected crashes or bugs.

The project includes a Makefile that simplifies the compilation and execution process. It also includes a detailed readme file that explains the usage and functionality of the application.

This project is ideal for learning socket programming in C language and can be used as a starting point for building more complex network applications.
