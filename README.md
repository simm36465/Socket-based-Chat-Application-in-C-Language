# Socket-based-Chat-Application-in-C-Language
This project is a simple chat application that allows multiple clients to connect and communicate with each other using sockets in C language. The chat application uses TCP/IP socket programming to establish a reliable and efficient communication network.

The server-side of the application uses socket programming to accept incoming connections from multiple clients, allowing them to communicate with each other in real-time. The client-side of the application also uses socket programming to establish a connection with the server and communicate with other clients.

The chat application features a user-friendly command-line interface that allows clients to join, leave, and send messages to a chat room. The chat room can support multiple clients at the same time, and messages are broadcasted to all connected clients.

This project is ideal for learning socket programming in C language and can be used as a starting point for building more complex network applications.
